<p>Hi, I'm Jingqi! I'm currently a 2nd-year studying computer science at Tufts University. My life goal is to live in a tree house by the sea.</p>
<p>I was born in China &amp; moved to the US when I was 3 years old. I grew up in Massachusetts. After graduating from Waltham High School, I came to Tufts and discovered my love for coding &amp; it changed my life!</p>
<p>For hobbies, I'm a huge jock, &amp; I love playing beach volleyball. Teaching is another one of my favorite things, &amp; I teach what I love whenever I can. I also love learning game development with friends on the weekend. Narrative video games are my jam &amp; Poptropica holds a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>Also, my wonderful friend Adrian drew my dream tree house. Isn't it gorgeous?!!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, have a lovely day!</p>
