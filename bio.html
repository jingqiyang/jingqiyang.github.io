<p>hi, i'm jingqi! i'm currently a 2nd-year studying computer science at tufts university. my life goal is to live in a tree house by the sea.</p>
<p>i was born in china &amp; moved to the US when i was 3 years old. i grew up in massachusetts. after graduating from waltham high school, i came to tufts and discovered my love for coding. it changed my life!</p>
<p>for hobbies, i'm a huge jock, and i love playing beach volleyball. teaching is another one of my favorite things, &amp; i teach what i love every spare moment i can. i also love learning game development with friends on the weekend. narrative video games are my jam. poptropica holds a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>also, my wonderful friend adrian drew me my dream tree house. isn't it gorgeous?!!</p>
