<h3>Current Projects</h3>

<ul class="unbulleted">

<li class="spaced"><strong>SoundScriber</strong>
<br>Work in progress, my attempt to convert audio files into human readable sheet music. Currently it can convert an audio file with a single chord into its respective notes.

<li class="spaced"><strong><a href="https://jingqiyang.github.io/morse/">Morse Code Practice</a></strong>
<br>Work in progress, but usable. Plays random words in morse code so you can practice auditorily interpreting it. I plan on adding a speed changing setting at some point.

<h3>Old School Stuff</h3>

<li class="spaced"><strong>TxtAd PL</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/myxnODnN-RM">[video]</a>
<br><span class="date">Fall 2019</span>
<br>TxtAd is a domain-specific language implemented in Haskell for developing text adventure games. TxtAd programs are compiled into text-based video games. TxtAd makes use of Template Haskell to perform analyses at compile-time to ensure games are well-formed.
<br>This was my passion project for Comp 150 Programming Language Design, my favorite course I've ever taken at Tufts. Check out the overview video linked in the title above!

<br><span class="date">Fall 2018</span>
<br>TA Simulator is a 2D video game made in Unity that teaches you how to TA computer science. Immerse yourself in the experience of being trapped in the claustrophobic Tufts CS Department building. Learn how to help your students in the various scenarios you may encounter in office hours!
