<p>I'm Jingqi! I'm currently a 4th-year student studying computer science at Tufts University. My main areas of interest are programming language design/functional programming and low-level programming/infrastructure. On the other side of learning, I am passionate about teaching computer science. It's the greatest thing in the world to be able to pass on knowledge and help others understand such interesting and complex concepts.
<p>Outside of computer science, I love playing volleyball and being in nature. I love taking walks through the woods and observing the world around me by photographing, identifying, and painting what I see. My life goal is to live in a tree house by the sea.</p>
