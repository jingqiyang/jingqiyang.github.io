<p>I'm Jingqi! I'm currently a 3rd-year student studying computer science at Tufts University. I love teaching, playing volleyball, and nature photography. I love being active and Iâ€™m all about taking walks through the woods, looking at and painting landscapes, tree identification, stuff like that. My life goal is to live in a tree house by the sea.</p>
