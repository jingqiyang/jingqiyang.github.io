<p>I'm Jingqi! My pronouns are he/they. I'm currently a software engineer at American Express, and I graduated from Tufts in May 2020.</p>
<p>My main areas of interest are programming language design and functional programming. I'm also something of an amateur game developer and I love combining game development with PL design. On the other side of learning, one of my favorite things in the world is teaching computer science! I just think it's the greatest thing to be able to pass on knowledge and help others understand interesting and complex concepts in the world of CS.
<p>Outside CS, I love playing volleyball and being in nature. I love taking walks through the woods and observing the world around me by photographing, identifying, and painting what I see. My life goal is to one day live in a tree house.</p>
