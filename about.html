<p>I'm Jingqi! I'm currently a 4th-year student studying computer science at Tufts University. My main areas of interest are programming language design/functional programming and low-level programming/infrastructure. On the other side of learning, I am also passionate about teaching computer science. It's the greatest thing in the world to be able to pass on knowledge and help others understand such interesting and complex concepts.
<p>Outside of computer science, I love playing volleyball, hiking, and nature photography. I love being active and Iâ€™m all about taking walks through the woods, looking at and painting landscapes, tree identification, stuff like that. My life goal is to live in a tree house by the sea.</p>
